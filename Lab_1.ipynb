        "- Discovering the features and differences between `Code` and `markdown` blocks\n",
        "- Viewing, and opening your local files in your local directories\n",
        "- Creating and formatting your own `code` and `markdown` blocks\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of the lab, you will be able to:\n",
        "- Effectively navigate the interface of Jupyter notebooks\n",
        "- Employ different notebook features to create, edit, format, rearrange, and manipulate `code` and `markdown` blocks\n",
        "- Understand the fundamental differences of `code` and `Markdown` blocks and their intended uses in a notebook\n",
        "- Navigate your local directories, and attach/embed files and links in your notebook\n",

        "The tool you're currently using is called JupyterHub Notebook, and we will be using this to complete labs and homeworks throughout the course. JupyterHub Notebook is principally used to write and edit code to examine and work with our data. You can also embed text and plots in notebooks, which makes it a great medium for combining code and analysis. JupyterHub is the server on which we store JupyterHub Notebooks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Much like having to learn how to use a lab for a chemistry course, you will need to learn how to use data science equipment, and JupyterHub and Jupyter notebooks are important data science lab tools. This first lab will take you on a tour of a Jupyter notebook. Without further ado, let's explore our notebook.\n",
